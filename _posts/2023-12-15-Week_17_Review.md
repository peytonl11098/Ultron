# Week Review
This week, I finished my MCQ Quiz and the Reflection on my blog. I worked a lot on getting my grades in from the team teach lessons, using Github to create a table where I could input my scores and link to the tangibles of my work. I used many external resources prior to taking the College Board test, such as YouTube videos, College Board videos, and the team teach lessons.
