# Memories and Learnings
I have good memories from the beginning of the trimester when everything seemed very new to my partner and I. My favorite memory is when I created a table to track the statistics of several Premier League teams from the 2022-2023 season. I also remember the ideation process for our passion project, of which we drafted out several ideas and chose which one would be optimal for us.
- I became familiar myself with js
- I became especially familiar with Python and its pseudocode equivalents during the process of team teaaching
- I learned how to become a frontend developer

# Reflective Summary
I have learned an extensive knowledge on coding frontend and a narrow understanding on backend. My team and I were able to use html, javascript, and Python in order to code our passion project, and my partner projects.
