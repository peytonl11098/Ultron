title: Review Ticket
description: My Review for the First Week of CSP. This week was full of different challenges as I started a little late after switching from a Cloud server to MacOS. Also, when attempting to set up tools such as the bundle install, I ran into an issue regarding the location of my gemfile. However, I was able to resolve the issue by reentering the lines of code preceding the bundle install, making sure I had all the necessary lines installed and the correct (new) repository.
