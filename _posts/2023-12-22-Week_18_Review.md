# Week Review
This week, I finished my Individual Review. The preparation took a long time because I had to update all of my week reviews and week planning because I had been behind the entire trimester. However, I did receive an 8.5/10 on the review, which I was not very happy with, but because of my effort, I deserved it. Next trimester, I will work harder so that I can increase my seed score and get above a 93%.
