    "\n",
    "- Brief discussion on additional security features (e.g., email verification, two-factor authentication).\n",
    "- Emphasis on following best practices for security and privacy.\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Suggestions\n",
    "Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS):\n",
    "Ensure that all communication between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and protects sensitive information during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Token-Based Authentication:\n",
    "Implement token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth, to securely manage user sessions. Tokens should be generated securely, have a limited lifespan, and be securely stored on the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure Password Storage:\n",
    "Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user passwords from being exposed in the event of a data breach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication Rate Limiting:\n",
    "Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints. This can involve limiting the number of login attempts within a specified time period to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure User Registration:\n",
    "Implement validation and sanitization checks on user registration inputs to prevent injection attacks. Verify the authenticity of email addresses and usernames during the registration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):\n",
    "Encourage or require users to enable MFA to add an additional layer of security. This can involve using one-time codes sent via SMS, email, or authenticator apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Session Management:\n",
    "Implement secure session management practices. Ensure that session tokens are securely stored and transmitted, and consider implementing session timeout and re-authentication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:\n",
    "Implement measures to protect against CSRF attacks. Use anti-CSRF tokens and ensure that requests from legitimate users originate from trusted sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Validation and Sanitization:\n",
    "Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use parameterized queries for database interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging and Monitoring:\n",
    "Implement comprehensive logging for login/signup activities. Monitor and log failed login attempts, unusual patterns, and potential security events to detect and respond to security incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Key Security:\n",
    "If applicable, secure API keys used for authentication and authorization. Ensure that keys are kept confidential, rotated regularly, and that access is restricted to only necessary entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Security Audits and Updates:\n",
    "Conduct regular security audits of your codebase and dependencies. Stay updated on security best practices and promptly apply patches and updates to address any vulnerabilities.\n",
